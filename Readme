This is project of simple Real Time System game. Game was created in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). Program supports multithreading managed by C# Mutex class. 

Game allows user (Red Team) to play against computer (Blue Team). Game is simulation of battle between spaceships. Blue team spaceships attack random enemies, when red team spaceships target can be chosen. All red team spaceships attack one chosen enemy. In the game there is ability to choose how much spaceships  we want to have in a team (2, 3 or 4, but implementation has no limitation so it can be any number). Every spaceship needs energy to renew its shield, and plasma to shoot. Each team has two energy and plasma generators. Every team member has access to that generators. If spaceship finds left energy generator empty, it switches to right one. If both generators are empty action is not executed. If spaceships shield level comes to 0, deamge points are substracted from hit points (HP). If spaceships HP comes to 0 ship is defeated and stops working. If all members in team are defeated there is end of game and there appears message which team has won. Game can be restarted in every moment.

In this game every generator and every spaceship is seperate thread which is is executed in parrarel way. Every spaceships thread can affect on other spaceship thread during the shooting to the enemy. Also every spaceship affects generators threads.
